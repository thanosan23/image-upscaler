# Image Upscaler

An image upscaler built using Next.js, Tailwindcss, Upload.io, and Replicate.

## How does it work?
This web service uses [SwinIR](https://github.com/JingyunLiang/SwinIR) to upscale the image. The model is served on Replicate. The UI is made using Next.js and Tailwindcss. The program stores files using Upload.io.
